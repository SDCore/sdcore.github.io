<b>Route 60 Auto Wash & Detail - Detail Ticket Manager</b><br />
<b>Description</b><br />
This car wash used paper detail tickets, so I volunteered<br />
to create a website for the sole purpose of creating<br />
accessible anywhere with an internet connection.<br />
Tickets were, of course, secured by an account so no<br />
one except the manager was able to edit them, but<br />
it made creating tickets a lot easier. This is still<br />
used to this day.
