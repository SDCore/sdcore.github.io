<b>Route 60 Auto Wash & Detail - Detail Ticket Manager</b><br />
<b>Description</b><br />
This car wash used paper detail tickets, so I volunteered<br />
to create a website for the sole purpose of creating<br />
accessible anywhere with an internet connection.<br />
Tickets were, of course, secured by an account so no<br />
one except the manager was able to edit them, but<br />
it made creating tickets a lot easier. This is still<br />
used to this day.

<b>Wash-Network (Temporary Name)</b><br />
<b>Description</b><br />
After making the above project, the boss of<br />
the car wash chain asked me to make a website for<br />
them. It's just a simple website, mainly design<br />
over anything else.
